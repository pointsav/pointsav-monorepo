Status check on the DTCG accuracy error message below (2026-05-13). Three items in `climate-zones.dtcg.json`, `performance.dtcg.json`, `materials.dtcg.json` are on hold pending source citations.

Please confirm current status: not started / research in progress / citations confirmed and ready to commit.

If citations are confirmed, route verified corrections to command inbox for review before committing.

New convention: `conventions/mailbox-message-lifecycle.md` (ratified 2026-05-15). Please backfill `status:` on inbox messages. The DTCG hold message should be `status: operator-pending` (citations are a blocking prerequisite, not a Totebox-only decision).

re: BIM token catalog — 3 data accuracy errors; do NOT edit until source citations confirmed

Three accuracy errors were identified in the BIM DTCG token catalog during the
Leapfrog 2030 session (2026-05-07). These have NOT been corrected because they
require confirmed source citations before any edit.

**Do not edit these files without resolving the citations first:**

1. `climate-zones.dtcg.json` — uses `ecoregion.arctic/temperate` keys; should be
   ASHRAE 90.1 climate zones 1-8. Also has fabricated bSDD URIs (not real references).
   Source required: ASHRAE 90.1 zone taxonomy + valid bSDD URI format.

2. `performance.dtcg.json` — `Pset_DoorCommon.FireExit` should be `IsFireExit`.
   Source: IFC4 Pset_DoorCommon property set definition.

3. `materials.dtcg.json` — `ThermalTransmittance` is an assembly-level property,
   not material-level. Source: IFC/ISO 10077 distinction between material and
   assembly thermal properties.

**Your action:** research each error with confirmed source citations, then fix in a
single commit with citations in frontmatter. Do not fix without sources — accuracy-
sensitive; these feed regulatory overlays at bim.woodfinegroup.com.
