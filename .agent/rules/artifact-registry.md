# project-gis Artifact Registry

Persistent record of all editorial, design, and data artifacts being built
for this project. Updated as artifacts are staged, dispatched, or completed.
Companion to `tasks.md` (sprint history) and `outstanding-todo.md` (backlog).

Routing:
- TOPIC / GUIDE / TEXT / PROSE → `project-editorial`
- DESIGN-RESEARCH / DESIGN-TOKEN / COMPONENT → `project-design`
- DATA artifacts remain in this archive

## Maintenance

- When an artifact is dispatched to project-editorial/project-design, update status to DISPATCHED + commit hash
- When an artifact is returned (approved/rejected), update status
- Add new artifacts here at the time they are planned — do not wait until staging
