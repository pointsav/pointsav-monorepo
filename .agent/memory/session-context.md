# Session context — rolling 3-session summary

## 2026-06-05 | Totebox | claude-code (CSV TOKEN_SHAPE update pass)

**Done this session:**
- **WCP-MASTER-ENTITY-REGISTRY_V3.csv committed** — commit `19a7b705` (jwoodfine). 76 rows
  (header + 75 data rows). Changes applied:
  - Rows 4–59: TOKEN_SHAPE updated from ad-hoc human-readable labels to actual CSS token class
    names (e.g. `token-base token-green`, `token-yellow`, `token-blue-ellipse-dotted`).
    Verified by reading all 14 chart HTML files. Used highest-JW-number chart when classes conflict.
  - Rows 70–93 (management chart): structural fix — CSS class moved from JURISDICTION column →
    TOKEN_SHAPE; X/Y coordinates cleared from TOKEN_SHAPE and EXTRA_METADATA_LEGAL.
  - Bottom 4 duplicate rows (NODE_IDs 17/32/33/34, chart-export artifact) removed.
- **Nodes with empty TOKEN_SHAPE** (not found in any chart): 8, 10–14 (Ireland fund service
  providers), 51 (Global Management), 52–54 (Holdings entities). Flagged in NEXT.md.
- **Key class resolutions:** node 50 = `token-blue-ellipse-dotted` (not `token-blue-dashed`);
  node 45 SPV Manager = `token-orange-solid` (JW21/JW19 win over JW11 purple); node 9 ELTIF =
  `token-orange-ellipse-dashed`; node 31 Woodfine Buildings = `token-grey-solid` (JW21 wins).
- **Stage 6 outbox updated** — new msg-id project-orgcharts-20260605-stage6-registry-csv.

**Pending / carry-forward:**
- Stage 6 — outbox updated (supersedes earlier message)
- Customer leg MANIFEST — outbox still pending Command Session
- GUIDE-orgchart-authoring — staged, project-editorial to deliver
- Wiki leg — milestone-gated (JW7+JW9 REVIEW)
- archive-2026-06-01/ deletion — 2026-07-01
- TOKEN_SHAPE for 9 uncharted nodes — add when new charts created

**Operator preferences surfaced:**
- Comfortable running multi-step data tasks on auto mode.

## 2026-06-05 | Totebox | claude-code (auto-mode NEXT.md cleanup pass)

**Done this session:**
- **Gitignored `archive-2026-06-01/`** — commit `fe99d71b` (pwoodfine). Directory contains
  misplaced git repo clones (design-system + 2 media-assets); cannot be tracked. Per
  archive README, deletion review 2026-07-01.
- **Stage 6 outbox message sent** — commit `9c422878` (jwoodfine). 3 prior commits + this
  session queued for Command Session promote. msg-id: project-orgcharts-20260605-stage6-3commits.
- **Customer leg — GUIDE drafted + MANIFEST outboxed** — commit `fc7c720d` (pwoodfine).
  `GUIDE-orgchart-authoring.draft.md` staged to drafts-outbound → project-editorial.
  MANIFEST content sent to command via outbox; pending admin-tier commit to
  `woodfine-fleet-deployment/cluster-totebox-corporate/MANIFEST.md`.
- **Bencal naming resolved** — Operator confirmed BPC / "Bencal Private Capital Inc." is
  canonical (2026-06-05). No BCL files found in deployment instance (grep confirmed).
  Memory + NEXT.md updated.

**Pending / carry-forward:**
- Stage 6 — outbox sent; Command Session to act
- Customer leg MANIFEST — outbox sent; Command Session to commit to woodfine-fleet-deployment
- GUIDE-orgchart-authoring — staged to drafts-outbound; project-editorial to deliver
- Wiki leg — milestone-gated (JW7+JW9 REVIEW)
- archive-2026-06-01/ deletion — 2026-07-01

**Operator preferences surfaced:**
- BPC (Bencal Private Capital Inc.) confirmed as canonical Bencal name (2026-06-05).
- Comfortable delegating housekeeping tasks to auto mode.

## 2026-06-04 | Totebox | claude-code (startup sweep — contamination cleanup)

**Done this session:**
- Startup sweep: confirmed role (Totebox), wrote session lock, read manifest (contaminated —
  project-marketing), read NOTAM (clear), read inbox.
- **Inbox ACK'd:** Command message `command-20260603-ack-3-design-drafts-committed-green-toke`
  — 3 DESIGN drafts committed + promoted to `pointsav-design-system` (commits 0e6f37e /
  aca9646 / 252a035); `--wf-green` updated to `#198038` (IBM Carbon Green 70); green drift
  fully resolved. Archived to inbox-archive.md.
- **Mailbox headers corrected:** inbox.md, outbox.md, inbox-archive.md — all were
  contaminated with project-marketing / project-intelligence owner headers. Committed `f3e20162`.
- **Identity files restored:** CLAUDE.md (from git a721bf19), .agent/manifest.md (from git
  34178889), session-start.md (rewritten), NEXT.md (rewritten), session-context.md
  (rewritten), .agent/briefs/README.md (rewritten). 6 contaminated top-level BRIEFs
  archived to .agent/briefs/archive/. Single commit this session.
- Stage 6 pending for f3e20162 + identity restoration commit. Command Session to promote.

**Pending / carry-forward:**
- Stage 6 (two commits)
- Bencal naming conflict: BPC vs BCL — operator decision needed
- Customer leg + Wiki leg pending (see NEXT.md)
- archive-2026-06-01/ disposition

**Operator preferences surfaced:** N/A (startup-only session).

## 2026-06-01 | Totebox | claude-code (Bencal JW2/JW3 chart audit + DESIGN drafts)

**Done this session:**
- Moved all working files from `current-org-chart-html/` to `inputs/current-org-chart-html/`
  (commit `7867b88d`) — single canonical location established.
- Produced 3 DESIGN drafts from Bencal JW2/JW3 chart audit (commit `b1154623`):
  1. `DESIGN-TOKEN-CHANGE`: `--wf-teal` + `--wf-red` custom properties (token-teal-red draft;
     Master co-sign pending at time of staging)
  2. `DESIGN-RESEARCH`: Bencal chart green value drift decision record
  3. `DESIGN-COMPONENT`: `org-chart-node-pill` teal + grey modifier variants
  All 3 dispatched to project-design via outbox.
- Noted green drift issue: Bencal WCP charts use `#198038` but canonical `--wf-green` was
  `#54924E`. Decision deferred to operator (resolved 2026-06-03 — see entry above).
- JW3 marketing memo (pure IR overview) written and placed in `inputs/current-org-chart-html/`.
- Bencal naming conflict surfaced: JW2 "Bencal Private Capital Inc." (BPC) vs JW3
  "Bencal Corporation" (BCL) — unresolved, operator action needed.

**Pending / carry-forward (all resolved by 2026-06-04):**
- DESIGN drafts: all 3 committed + promoted ✓
- Green token decision: resolved ✓
- Inbox/outbox contamination: fixed this startup ✓

**Operator preferences surfaced:** Prefers compliance doc (JW3) as source of truth for
corporate names. Comfortable with staged multi-session workflows.

## 2026-05-22–23 | Totebox | claude-code (chart token coverage investigation)

**Done this session:**
- Investigated chart token coverage across design-system layers.
- Confirmed `token-chart-semantic.yaml` + chart component CSS (nodes, connectors, panels,
  governance, tiers, matrix, venn) already committed in `pointsav-design-system` sub-clone
  at commit `ebdd101` (v0.2.0, 2026-05-21).
- Identified that `tokens/charts/` does not yet exist in vendor canonical — Stage 6 pending.
- Investigated `design.pointsav.com` pipeline: served by `app-privategit-design` reading from
  `dtcg-vault/` (DTCG JSON format), separate from the YAML-canonical layer.
- Wrote two outbox messages: (1) to `totebox@project-design` requesting DTCG conversion +
  dtcg-vault component entries; (2) to `command@claude-code` requesting outbox sweep + Stage 6.
- Command Session actioned both on 2026-05-22 (commit `537f15e`): project-design message
  relayed; Stage 6 marked in-progress.

**Pending / carry-forward:**
- `--gold` CSS variant in `nodes.css` has no entity-role in `token-chart-semantic.yaml` —
  needs Master co-sign decision before DTCG entry.
- 87 unstaged modified files in `pointsav-design-system` sub-clone working tree flagged to
  Command Session — root cause unknown; may be drift from canonical.

**Operator preferences surfaced:** Asks direct questions about token coverage and pipeline
state; prefers concise answers with clear statement of what exists vs. what is still needed;
comfortable with session-layer explanations (Command vs. Totebox).
